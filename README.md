A small fansite for my new favourite band the runarounds!

It includes a short description of the show (to get the people hooked yk), the band members and their positions and a link to watch the show on prime video. As well as a fancy 
nav bar at the top (which took a bit of figuring out). All in css and html.

I went for a red, black, and white theme to match the band’s vibe 
If I had more time to commit to this, I’d add the official soundtrack and include more characters or fun behind-the-scenes bits.

thats it really <3
